# Zelda2MapDump
Zelda2MapDump is a quick hack to dump the map from Zelda II - The Adventure of Link, to .png-files. The idea was to enable a quick way to create maps for the various hacks of Zelda II out there.

Tested to run on PHP5 with the GD-library.

Run on command line with "php zelda2mapdump.php <rom file>"
This will create map{1-4}.png in the same directory. They can be viewed next to each other from maps.html.
